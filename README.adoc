= Ammitto EU Sanctions Data Repository

== Purpose

This repository stores downloaded and processed sanctions data from the
European Union (EU) Consolidated List of Sanctions.

The data is maintained by the Ammitto project and used by the `ammitto` Ruby
gem for querying international sanctions information.

== Legal Basis

The EU sanctions are implemented through Common Foreign and Security Policy
(CFSP) regulations. Key legal instruments include:

* Council Regulations based on Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning
  of the European Union (TFEU)
* Council Decisions adopted under Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union
* Council Common Positions adopted under Title V of the Treaty on European
  Union

The consolidated list is maintained by the European Commission's Service for
Foreign Policy Instruments (FPI).
