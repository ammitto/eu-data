  function: Reza Aghazadeh is an Iranian national, member of the Expediency Discernment
    Council. He served as Head of the Atomic Energy Organization between 1997 and
    2009. His positions have led him to be at the forefront of the development of
    Iran’s nuclear programme. He is still consulted by his AEOI colleagues on nuclear
    issues. Reza Aghazadeh is therefore responsible for directly participating in
    Iran’s nuclear programme and nuclear escalation.
