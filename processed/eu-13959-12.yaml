    Marina Ushakova is a judge of the Appellate Military Court of Russia.
    As a member of the appellate panel of judges of the Appellate Military Court of Russia, Marina Ushakova rejected the appeal of Alexei Gorinov, a former municipal deputy in the Krasnoselsky district of Moscow, against a politically motivated sentence. In a procedurally flawed trial, Alexei. Gorinov was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment in a strict regime colony under Article 205.2 of the Russian Criminal Code for “justification of terrorism”. Alexei Gorinov’s sentence was based on statements he made in a conversation with his cellmates in which he allegedly recognised that Crimea was Ukrainian territory and the Azov regiment was part of the Ukrainian army.
