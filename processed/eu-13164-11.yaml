  function: Alexey Kharlamov is the Chairman of the Moscow Regional Court who was
    previously a judge of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation and a member
    of the Presidium of the Supreme Court. In his position as member of the Presidium
    of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, in April 2018, he upheld the verdict
    against the opposition politician Alexei Navalny and his brother Oleg in the Yves
    Rocher case even though, in October 2017, the European Court of Human Rights ruled
    that Russia had violated the Navalny brothers’ right to a fair trial and punishment
    solely on the basis of the law.
