    Boris Kozhevnikov is a Deputy Chairman of the Appellate Military Court of Russia.
    As deputy chairman of the Appellate Military Court of Russia, Boris Kozhevnikov rejected the appeal of Alexei Gorinov, a former municipal deputy in the Krasnoselsky district of Moscow, against a politically motivated sentence. In a procedurally flawed trial, Alexei Gorinov was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment in a strict regime penal colony under Article 205.2 of the Russian Criminal Code for “justification of terrorism”. Alexei Gorinov’s sentence was based on statements he made in a conversation with his cellmates in which he allegedly recognised that Crimea was Ukrainian territory and the Azov regiment was part of the Ukrainian army. Furthermore, Kozhevnikov upheld the sentences of imprisonment for Andrei Boyarshinov, Ibragim Orudzhev, Alexei Nuriev and Roman Nasryev on politically motivated charges in alleged terrorism related cases.
